# Commit Messages

When making git commits:

- **Never** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` or any Co-authored-by line to commit messages.
- Use only the commit message text the user or context specifies (e.g. "chore: add root .gitignore and README").
- Do not append trailers or footers to commit messages unless the user explicitly asks for them.
